# Infrastructure As Code with Terraform and AWS

#### Overview

HashiCorp Terraform is an infrastructure as code tool that lets you define both cloud and on-prem resources in human-readable configuration files that you can version, reuse, and share.

You can then use a consistent workflow to provision and manage all of your infrastructure throughout its lifecycle. 

Terraform can manage low-level components like compute, storage, and networking resources, as well as high-level components like DNS entries and SaaS features.

In this workshop we will use Terraform with AWS to create VPC, Subnet, EC2 , Route table, Internet gateway, Security group
